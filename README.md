# PostManager
This project uses retrofit, MVVM, data binding, BaseObservable, LiveData and some custom views and layouts in order to display posts from a certain API.
At this level, what the app does is:
1. collect posts from an API
2. display posts in a recyclerview using an adapter
3. recyclerview supports swipe buttons, which are buttons that appear upon swiping a row to the left.
4. recyclerview can perform delete and edit posts.
5. creation and update of a post are done via a custom BottomSheet.
6. Details of a post can be viewed in a separate activity.

Thanks for your interest.
